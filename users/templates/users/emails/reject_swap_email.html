<h2>Hi, {{ from_profile_ctx.profile.fb_name }}</h2>
<p>{{ to_profile_ctx.profile.fb_name }} has rejected your request to swap votes. This probably means they found a match in a more important swing state.
{% if from_profile_ctx.pending_matches %}
<br />
You still have {{ from_profile_ctx.pending_matches|length }} pending swaps, so don't worry too much!
{% endif %}

<p>
{% if from_profile_ctx.good_potential_matches %}
{% with num_matches=from_profile_ctx.good_potential_matches|length %}
You have {{ num_matches }} good potential match{{ num_matches|pluralize:"es" }}. Come back to <a href="https://voteswap.us{% url "swap" %}">voteswap.us</a> and propose swaps to more friends!
{% endwith %}
{% else %}
Please come back to <a href="https://voteswap.us{% url "swap" %}">voteswap.us</a> and share voteswap on facebook to get more of your friends on board.

Our votes matter more when we vote strategically in swing states; help us save our country from Trump.
