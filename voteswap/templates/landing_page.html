    <p>
      Third party voters have all the power this election. Voting for Johnson
      in {{ swing_states }} will split the vote and make Clinton lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't let Trump win, swap your vote! <b>Gary Johnson voters in in swing
      states</b> are matched with <b>Clinton voters in safe states</b>.
      Johnson gets the same number of votes, and Trump loses. Don't split the
      vote like we did with Nader and Al Gore in 2000.
