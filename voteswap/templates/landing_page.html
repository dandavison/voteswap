        Third party voters have all the power this election. Voting for Johnson
        in {{ swing_states }} will split the vote and make Clinton lose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't let Trump win, swap your vote! <b>Gary Johnson voters in in swing
        states</b> are matched with <b>Clinton voters in safe states</b>.
        Johnson gets the same number of votes, and Trump loses. Don't split the
        vote like we did with Nader and Al Gore in 2000.

        When you join <a href="http://voteswap.us">voteswap</a> you will be
        matched with a voter in your Facebook friends network. Your
        match will be someone your know personally or a friend of a friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        You're limited to swapping with someone in your network because we
        think this will keep everyone honest. You can trust your friends to
        follow through on their pledge to swap and save the presidency.

        You can propose vote swaps with several friends. We automatically
        rank your friends by the impact. If you're in a safe state, friends in
        important swing states are shown first. If you're in a swing state,
        then friends in very safe states are shown first.
      </p>
      <p>
        After proposing swaps and talking to several friends, you can accept
        one swap. On election day we'll send you both an email to remind you
        who you're swapping with.

        This is the most important election in decades. We can either let a

        country. Or we can come together and elect someone with decades of
        experience in domestic and foreign policy, who listens to advice and
        has a calm, clear head. She may not be your favorite candidate, but
        she won't fuck it up. So do your part and don't fuck this up either.

    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p>
        After the election, while the surprisingly high third-party turnout is
        still on everyone's minds, we can start a dialogue on changing our
        election process to use
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">ranked choice voting</a>,
        aka instant runoff elections. This system of voting lets you write down
        your candidates in order, so if your first choice doesn't win, your
        vote goes to your second choice, and so on. This allows votes for third
        parties (or fourth, or fifth, or ...) to not be wasted and let the
        least favored candidate win.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ranked choice voting is used around the world:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting_in_the_United_States#2006_San_Francisco_results">cities and states in the United States</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system_of_Australia#Preferential_voting">congressional elections in Australia</a>, and for various elections in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_use_of_instant-runoff_voting">India, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ranked choice voting is not without its flaws, but they can be
        addressed by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet method</a>
        to count votes. Condorcet voting prevents a few counter-intuitive
        outcomes of ranked choice voting, and should be our preferred method.
