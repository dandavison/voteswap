    <h1>Make your vote count</h1>
    <p>
      The only way to stop Trump and show your unhappiness with the political
      process is to swap votes. Gary Johnson voters in in swing states are
      matched with Clinton votes in safe Clinton states. This ensures that
      Johnson voters don't split the vote and let the worst option -- Trump --
      into the White House.

    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
    <p>
      When you join <a href="http://voteswap.us">voteswap</a> you will be matched
      with a compatible voter in your Facebook friends network. Your match will
      be someone your know personally, or a friend of a friend. We think this
      will keep out liars and almost everyone will follow through with their
      pledges.

    <h1>After the election</h1>
    <p>
      After the election, while the surprisingly high third-party turnout is
      still on everyone's minds, we can start a dialogue on changing our election
      process to use <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">ranked choice voting</a>,
      aka instant runoff elections. This system of voting lets you write down
      your candidates in order, allowing votes for third parties to not take away
      from votes for other parties.
