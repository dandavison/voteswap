        <b>Gary Johnson voters in in swing states</b> are matched with
        <b>Clinton voters in safe Clinton states</b>. This ensures that
        Johnson voters don't split the vote and put Trump in the White House
        (think Nader voters making Al Gore lose Florida in 2000a).

      <p>
        When you join <a href="http://voteswap.us">voteswap</a> you will be
        matched with a compatible voter in your Facebook friends network. Your
        match will be someone your know personally, or a friend of a friend. We
        think this will keep out liars and almost everyone will follow through
        with their pledges.

      <h1>After the election</h1>
      <p>
        After the election, while the surprisingly high third-party turnout is
        still on everyone's minds, we can start a dialogue on changing our
        election process to use
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">ranked choice voting</a>,
        aka instant runoff elections. This system of voting lets you write down
        your candidates in order, allowing votes for third parties to not take
        away from votes for other parties.
