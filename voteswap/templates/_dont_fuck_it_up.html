      This is the most important election in decades. We can either let a
      bigoted, racist, xenophobic, unstable little dictator destroy our
      country. Or we can come together and elect someone with decades of
      experience in domestic and foreign policy, who listens to advice and
      has a calm, clear head. She may not be your favorite candidate, but
      she won't fuck it up. So do your part and don't fuck this up either.
